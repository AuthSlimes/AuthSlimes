# Welcome to the AuthSlime Project

The AuthSlime Project is focused on generating random, cryptographically validated AuthSlime. They are available for sale on Opensea.io.

The AuthSlime Project is backed by a program that generates the precious Slime. Each slime we create has these attributes:

### 1. X509v3 Certificates

For each AuthSlime that gets created by the AuthSlime generator, it creates an [RSA Keypair](http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf) with a key size of 2048 bits. It then creates a CSR, defining the AuthSlime's full name, Slime ID and color. It places those values in the Common Name field of the CSR - `CN = fullname:slime_id:color`.
It then submits the CSR to the Slime Signing Intermediate CA, which is Intermediate Certificate Authority using a prime256v1 (ASN.1) ECC keypair. The Slime Signing Intermediate CA signs/issues an X509v3 end-entity certificate according to the values in the CSR. It signs using ecdsa-with-SHA256. These certificates authenticate each AuthSlime in the Slime database which prevents any forged slimes. If you own a AuthSlime, you can look up its fullname/slime ID in the Certificates folder and decode it using openssl (`openssl x509 -in AuthSlimeCertificate.pem -noout -text`) or an [online decoder](https://decoder.link/result). In addition, each AuthSlime has the signature embedded in the picture so you can compare it with the signature on the certificate. Please check out the Cryptography section for more information about checking validation for the AuthSlimes.

### 2. Randomly generated name

Each AuthSlime has a semi-random name. They often come up really slime sounding. For instance, how does "Lorx Roqwkdl" not sound like a slime name? ;) Here is how the names are generated.

    rand_num = random.randint(1,9) # for the last name, it uses (1,10)
    firstletter = random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase)
    secondletter = random.choice(vowels)
    rest = ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_lowercase, k = rand_num))    
    name = firstletter + secondletter + rest
    

### 3. Randomly generated color
We generate a random color for the AuthSlime.  

### 4. Unique Slime ID
The unique Slime ID is placed in our AuthSlime Database to ensure that no two slimes have the same ID. The ID will show you the version of the AuthSlime. For instance, "v1-" means version 1 AuthSlimes.

More AuthSlime attributes to come in later versions of slime!

## Example

![Lorx_Roqwkd](https://github.com/AuthSlimes/AuthSlime/blob/main/AuthSlime_definitions.png?raw=true)


The Signature attribute can be found in the decoded AuthSlime certificate. Look towards the bottom in the Signature Algorithm field. The Signature in the AuthSlime picture should be the same, except for the ":" characters. For example, this is Lorx's signature.

## Cryptographic Features

### How to verify the AuthSlime Certificate was signed by our Intermediate CA (Slime Signing Intermediate CA)

You can use the Certificate chain (the Intermediate and Root CA Certificates) to do this with openssl. The CA chain is found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AuthSlimes/AuthSlime/main/Slime_Certificate_Authority/CA_Chain.pem)

`openssl verify -CAfile CA_chain.pem AuthSlimeCertificate.pem`

You can also use the decoder [here](https://decoder.link/ca_matcher).  Just remember to place the intermediate certificate as the CA Certificate and the AuthSlime certificate as the end-entity.

Here are the links to the CAs. You can also check out the Slime_Certificate_Authority directory in this repo.
